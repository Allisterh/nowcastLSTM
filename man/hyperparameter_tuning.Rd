  data,

  n_models = 1,
  n_timesteps_grid = c(6, 12),
  fill_na_func_grid = c("mean"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_folds}{how many folds for rolling fold validation to do}

\item{init_test_size}{Ïµ [0,1]. What proportion of the data to use for testing at the first fold}

\item{pub_lags}{list of periods back each input variable is set to missing. I.e. publication lag of the variable. Leave empty to pick variables only on complete information, no synthetic vintages.}

\item{lags}{simulated periods back to test when selecting variables. E.g. -2 = simulating data as it would have been 2 months before target period, 1 = 1 month after, etc. So [-2, 0, 2] will account for those vintages in model selection. Leave empty to pick variables only on complete information, no synthetic vintages.}

\item{performance_metric}{performance metric to use for variable selection. Pass "RMSE" for root mean square error, "MAE" for mean absolute error, or "AICc" for correctd Akaike Information Criterion. Alternatively can pass a function that takes arguments of a pandas Series of predictions and actuals and returns a scalar. E.g. custom_function(preds, actuals).}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} containing the following elements:

\item{hyper_params}{liste of hyperparameters, access via df$hyper_params[[1]], etc.}
\item{performance}{performance metric of these hyperparameteres}
}
\description{
Pick best-performing hyperparameters for a given dataset. n_timesteps_grid has default grid for predicting quarterly variable with monthly series, may have to change per use case. E.g. [12,24] for a yearly target with monthly indicators. All parameters up to `optimizer_parameters` exactly the same as for any LSTM() model, provide a list with the values to check.
